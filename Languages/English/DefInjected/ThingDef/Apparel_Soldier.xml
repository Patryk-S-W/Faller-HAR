  <XAngelApparel_CatHood.description>A hood to protect the head.\nOn one occasion, a cat-beast woman freed the Fallers from a huge trafficking ring.\nThe woman was the guardian deity of the faction calling for the protection of the Fallers, and the other factions feared her, calling her the God of War.\nThis equipment is made in the style of what she wore.\nAlthough she is no longer with us, it is still customary for fallers to wear this cape in prayer for her blessing.</XAngelApparel_CatHood.description>
